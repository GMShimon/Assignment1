            <p>I perceive myself as an optimistic person. I don’t dwell on negativity, and as such I see opportunities in times of difficulties.

I am happy being optimistic because it gives me hope and courage to live on. I see myself as a unique individual. Hence, I have learned not to be intimidated of others.</p>

                <h2>salad</h2>
                <p>Much as it’s challenging to get enough protein without eating meat, it’s really tough to get a the daily fiber you need without eating vegetables that are high in fiber. Many common components of salad are high in fiber, in particular leafy greens such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage, and kale. There’s also good fiber to be had in broccoli, celery, carrots, gourds, and some beans. </p>

                <h2>Meat</h2>
                <p>Meat and poultry are great sources of protein. They also provide lots of other nutrients your body needs, like iodine, iron, zinc, vitamins (especially B12) and essential fatty acids. So it's a good idea to eat meat and poultry every week as part of your balanced diet.

                <h2>Fruits</h2>
                <p>Fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, and they are high in fiber. Fruits also provide a wide range of health-boosting antioxidants, including flavonoids. Eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables can reduce a person's risk of developing heart disease, cancer, inflammation, and diabetes.</p>
